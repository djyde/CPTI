CPTI means "Coding Personality Type Indicator". It's the MBTI for programmers.

## CPTI Explanation

### I/U Dimension

**I (Infrastructure) - Infrastructure Oriented**  
You focus more on system's underlying architecture, performance optimization, backend services, and technical infrastructure. You enjoy building stable and reliable systems, focusing on data flow, architectural design, and system scalability.

**U (User) - User Oriented**  
You focus more on user experience, interface interaction, frontend implementation, and product usability. You enjoy creating intuitive and beautiful interfaces, focusing on user needs and interaction design.

### R/X Dimension

**R (Reliable) - Stable and Reliable**  
You tend to choose proven and mature technical solutions, valuing code quality, test coverage, and system stability. You like to work according to best practices, ensuring long-term maintainability of projects.

**X (eXperimental) - Rapid Experimentation**  
You like to try new technologies and quickly build prototypes to validate ideas. You enjoy fast-paced iterative work and are willing to take certain risks to explore innovative possibilities.

### G/Q Dimension

**G (Good practices) - Craftsmanship Spirit**  
You pursue elegant and clean code, valuing design patterns, coding standards, and architectural aesthetics. You believe good code should be crafted like a work of art.

**Q (Questioning) - Exploratory Spirit**  
You are curious about technical principles and enjoy diving deep into underlying implementations and algorithms. You're not satisfied with surface-level usage and always want to understand "why" and "how to do it better".

### O/T Dimension

**O (On your own) - Independent Work**  
You prefer to work alone with focus and can independently complete complex technical tasks. You enjoy moments of deep thinking and perform best in quiet environments.

**T (Team) - Team Collaboration**  
You excel at collaborating with team members and enjoy sharing ideas and knowledge. You can effectively engage in cross-functional cooperation, inspiring creativity and problem-solving in team environments.

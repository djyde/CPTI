# CPTI – Coder Personality Type Indicator

**CPTI** is a personality framework designed for developers. Inspired by MBTI, it maps programmers into **16 types** based on four dimensions that reflect how we code, collaborate, and explore technology.

Unlike traditional personality systems, CPTI speaks the native language of engineers — code, infra, bugs, and side-projects.

## 🔑 The Four Dimensions

### 1. **U / I → User-facing vs Infra**

* **U (User-facing)**: Focused on UI, UX, design systems, and front-end work. Think in terms of how end users experience the product.
* **I (Infra)**: Focused on architecture, data, and system stability. Think in terms of scale, performance, and reliability.

### 2. **R / X → Reliable vs Experimental**

* **R (Reliable)**: Values stability, tests, documentation, and long-term maintainability. “If it’s not tested, it’s broken.”
* **X (Experimental)**: Loves prototyping, trying new frameworks, moving fast and breaking things. “Let’s ship and see what happens.”

### 3. **G / Q → Guild-like vs Quest-like**

* **G (Guild-like)**: Sees coding as a craft. Strives for elegant, readable, and maintainable solutions. Believes in clean design and patterns.
* **Q (Quest-like)**: Sees coding as exploration. Loves diving into unknowns, new languages, weird algorithms, or system internals.

### 4. **O / T → One-man vs Team-up**

* **O (One-man)**: Independent builder. Enjoys going full-stack solo, hacking away in deep focus.
* **T (Team-up)**: Collaborative. Enjoys pair programming, design reviews, and team rituals.

## 🧑‍💻 How CPTI Works

A CPTI type is represented by **four letters** — one from each dimension.
For example:

* **URGO** → *User-facing, Reliable, Guild-like, One-man*

  * “The Pixel Craftsman” who polishes UI details alone until they’re perfect.

* **IXQT** → *Infra, Experimental, Quest-like, Team-up*

  * “The Tech Adventurer” who rallies teammates to try bleeding-edge tools.

* **IRGT** → *Infra, Reliable, Guild-like, Team-up*

  * “The Architecture Guardian” who builds standards and protects stability.
